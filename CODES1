**1. Area of a Rectangle**
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the length and breadth of a rectangle. The program should then calculate and print the area.

```python
# Get input from the user for length and breadth
# The input() function returns a string, so we convert it to float
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
breadth = float(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area using the formula: area = length * breadth
area = length * breadth

# Print the result
# The f-string is a clean way to embed variables in a string
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter the length of the rectangle: 10
# Enter the breadth of the rectangle: 5
# The area of the rectangle is: 50.0
```

**2. Sum of Three Numbers**
Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

```python
# Get three numbers from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Calculate the sum
total_sum = num1 + num2 + num3

# Print the sum
print(f"The sum of the three numbers is: {total_sum}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter the first number: 10
# Enter the second number: 20
# Enter the third number: 30
# The sum of the three numbers is: 60

```

**3. BMI Calculator**
Create a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. The program should take the weight in kilograms and height in meters as input. The formula for BMI is BMI=height2weight.

```python
# Get weight in kilograms and height in meters from the user
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Calculate BMI using the formula
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Print the calculated BMI
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter your weight in kg: 70
# Enter your height in meters: 1.75
# Your BMI is: 22.86

```

**4. Check for Palindrome**
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forwards and backward).

```python
# Get a string from the user
s1 = input("Enter a string: ")

# Reverse the string using slicing [::-1]
s2 = s1[::-1]

# Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string
if s1 == s2:
    print(f"'{s1}' is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"'{s1}' is not a palindrome.")

# Sample Output 1:
# Enter a string: madam
# 'madam' is a palindrome.

# Sample Output 2:
# Enter a string: hello
# 'hello' is not a palindrome.

```

**5. Find the Largest of Three Numbers**
Write a program that finds and prints the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

```python
# Get three numbers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Use if-elif-else to compare the numbers and find the largest
if a >= b and a >= c:
    largest = a
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    largest = b
else:
    largest = c

# Print the largest number
print(f"The largest number is: {largest}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter the first number: 15
# Enter the second number: 8
# Enter the third number: 22
# The largest number is: 22

```

**6. Fibonacci Series**
Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to a number of terms specified by the user. The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...).

```python
# Get the number of terms from the user
n = int(input("How many terms in the Fibonacci series? "))

# Initialize the first two terms
a = 0
b = 1

# Handle edge cases for n=0 and n=1
if n <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
elif n == 1:
    print("Fibonacci series:")
    print(a)
else:
    print("Fibonacci series:")
    print(a)
    print(b)
    count = 2
    while count < n:
        c = a + b
        print(c)
        a = b
        b = c
        count += 1

# Sample Output:
# How many terms in the Fibonacci series? 7
# Fibonacci series:
# 0
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8

```

**7. Create a Simple Addition Function**
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Then, call the function with user input.

```python
# Define a function named 'add' that takes two arguments
def add(a, b):
    # Calculate the sum and return it
    return a + b

# Get two numbers from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Call the function and store the returned value
result = add(num1, num2)

# Print the final result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter the first number: 4.5
# Enter the second number: 6.5
# The sum of 4.5 and 6.5 is: 11.0

```

**8. Check for Even or Odd**
Create a program that asks the user for a number and uses an `if...else` statement to determine if the number is even or odd.

```python
# Get an integer from the user
number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Use the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is even
# If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, it's even
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"The number {number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"The number {number} is odd.")

# Sample Output 1:
# Enter an integer: 10
# The number 10 is even.

# Sample Output 2:
# Enter an integer: 7
# The number 7 is odd.
```

**9. Password and Username Checker**
Write a program that checks for a correct username and password. Use nested `if` statements to first verify the username and then the password.

```python
# Pre-defined username and password
correct_username = "admin"
correct_password = "password123"

# Get user input for username and password
username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = input("Enter your password: ")

# Check the username first
if username == correct_username:
    # If username is correct, check the password
    if password == correct_password:
        print("Login successful! Welcome.")
    else:
        print("Incorrect password. Access denied.")
else:
    print("Incorrect username. Access denied.")

# Sample Output:
# Enter your username: admin
# Enter your password: wrong_password
# Incorrect password. Access denied.
```

**10. String Reversal**
Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed string.

String Reverser Function

```python
# Define a function to reverse a string
def reverse_string(s):
    # Use slicing to reverse the string and return it
    return s[::-1]

# Get a string from the user
user_string = input("Enter a string to reverse: ")

# Call the function and print the result
reversed_str = reverse_string(user_string)
print(f"The reversed string is: {reversed_str}")

# Sample Output:
# Enter a string to reverse: hello
# The reversed string is: olleh
```
